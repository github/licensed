    consuming this file via license-tracking software should endeavor to understand
    which gem file you're downloading and using, so as not to misinterpret the contents
    of this file and the licenses of the software being distributed.\n\nYou can double-check
    the dependencies in your gem file by examining the output of `nokogiri -v` after
    installation, which will emit the complete set of libraries in use (for versions
    `>= 1.11.0.rc4`).\n\nIn particular, I'm sure somebody's lawyer, somewhere, is
    going to freak out that the LGPL appears in this file; and so I'd like to take
    special note that the dependency covered by LGPL, `libiconv`, is only being redistributed
    in the native Windows and native Darwin platform releases. It's not present in
    default, JavaⓇ, or native LinuxⓇ releases.\n\n\n## Platform Releases\n\n### Default
    platform release (\"ruby\")\n\nThe default platform release distributes the following
    dependencies in source form:\n\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n-
    [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n\nThis distribution can be
    identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the
    value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\" attribute.\n\n\n### Native LinuxⓇ platform
    releases (\"x86_64-linux\" and \"arm64-linux\")\n\nThe native LinuxⓇ platform
    release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n-
    [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n- [zlib](#zlib)\n\nThis
    distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification,
    which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"x86-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\"
    attribute.\n\n\n### Native Darwin (macOSⓇ) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\"
    and \"arm64-darwin\")\n\nThe native Darwin platform release distributes the following
    dependencies in source form:\n\n- [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n-
    [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n- [zlib](#zlib)\n- [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis
    distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification,
    which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its
    \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or
    \"macOSⓇ\" and is the operating system for many AppleⓇ computers.\n\n\n### Native
    WindowsⓇ platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\" and \"x64-mingw32\")\n\nThe native
    WindowsⓇ platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form:\n\n-
    [libxml2](#libxml2)\n- [libxslt](#libxslt)\n- [libgumbo and nokogumbo](#libgumbo-and-nokogumbo)\n-
    [zlib](#zlib)\n- [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis distribution can be identified
    by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar
    to \"x64-mingw32\" or \"x86-mingw32\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n\n\n###
    JavaⓇ (JRuby) platform release (\"java\")\n\nThe Java platform release distributes
    the following dependencies as compiled jar files:\n\n- [isorelax](#isorelax)\n-
    [jing](#jing)\n- [nekodtd](#nekodtd)\n- [nekohtml](#nekohtml)\n- [xalan](#xalan)\n-
    [xerces](#xerces)\n- [xml-apis](#xml-apis)\n\nThis distribution can be identified
    by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"java\"
    for its \"platform.os\" attribute.\n\n\n## Appendix: Dependencies' License Texts\n\nThis
    section contains a subsection for each potentially-distributed dependency, which
    includes the name of the license and the license text.\n\nPlease see previous
    sections to understand which of these potential dependencies is actually distributed
    in the gem file you're downloading and using.\n\n\n### libgumbo and nokogumbo\n\nApache

    Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n          form, that
    is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n          editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n          represent,
    as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n          of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n          separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n          the Work
    and Derivative Works thereof.\n    \n          \"Contribution\" shall mean any
    work of authorship, including\n          the original version of the Work and
    any modifications or additions\n          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,

    definition, \"submitted\"\n          means any form of electronic, verbal, or
    written communication sent\n          to the Licensor or its representatives,
    including but not limited to\n          communication on electronic mailing lists,

    by, or on behalf of, the\n          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
    improving the Work, but\n          excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise\n          designated in writing by the copyright owner as
    \"Not a Contribution.\"\n    \n          \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and
    any individual or Legal Entity\n          on behalf of whom a Contribution has
    been received by Licensor and\n          subsequently incorporated within the
    Work.\n    \n       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of\n          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
    \         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n          copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n          publicly display,
    publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\n          Work and such Derivative
    Works in Source or Object form.\n    \n       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\n          this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,\n          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable\n          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,\n          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,\n          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n
    \         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n          Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n          with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n          institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\n          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\n          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\n          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \         as of the date such litigation is filed.\n    \n       4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n          Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without\n          modifications, and in Source
    or Object form, provided that You\n          meet the following conditions:\n
    \   \n          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n              Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\n    \n          (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n    \n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative
    Works\n              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
    \             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n              excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Derivative
    Works; and\n    \n          (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as
    part of its\n              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
    must\n              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
    \             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n              pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n              of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative
    Works; within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along
    with the Derivative Works; or,\n              within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and\n              wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n    \n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and\n          may provide additional or different license terms
    and conditions\n          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
    or\n          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n    \n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
    explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the
    terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n    \n       6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n          names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n          except
    as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin
    of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n    \n       7. Disclaimer
    of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n          agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each\n          Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
    either express or\n          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
    any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
    \   \n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
    \         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n          unless
    required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n          negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You
    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work (including but
    not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages or
    losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n    \n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
    While redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
    choose to offer,\n          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
    indemnity,\n          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
    with this\n          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
    act only\n          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
    behalf\n          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n
    \         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your
    accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n    \n       END OF TERMS
    AND CONDITIONS\n    \n       APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your
    work.\n    \n          To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n

    \   \t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n    \t\t       Version 2, June 1991\n
    \   \n     Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin
    Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n     Everyone is permitted to
    copy and distribute verbatim copies\n     of this license document, but changing
    it is not allowed.\n    \n    [This is the first released version of the library
    GPL.  It is\n     numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n
    \   \n    \t\t\t    Preamble\n    \n      The licenses for most software are designed
    to take away your\n    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
    Public\n    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n
    \   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n    \n
    \     This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\n    specially
    designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\n    other libraries
    whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\n    your libraries, too.\n
    \   \n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n
    \   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n    have
    the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n    this service
    if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n    if you want it,
    that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs;
    and that you know you can do these things.\n    \n      To protect your rights,
    we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights
    or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These restrictions translate to certain
    responsibilities for you if\n    you distribute copies of the library, or if you
    modify it.\n    \n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library,
    whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
    that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
    the source\n    code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\n
    \   complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\n    with
    the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n    it.  And
    you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n    \n      Our method
    of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n    the library, and (2)
    offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify the library.\n    \n      Also, for each distributor's protection,
    we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty
    for this free\n    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed
    on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n
    \   version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n    the
    original authors' reputations.\n    \f\n      Finally, any free program is threatened
    constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies
    distributing free\n    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus
    in effect\n    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent
    this,\n    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n
    \   free use or not licensed at all.\n    \n      Most GNU software, including
    some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n    GNU General Public License, which
    was designed for utility programs.  This\n    license, the GNU Library General
    Public License, applies to certain\n    designated libraries.  This license is
    quite different from the ordinary\n    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't
    assume that anything in it is\n    the same as in the ordinary license.\n    \n
    \     The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n
    \   they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n
    \   program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n
    \   changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n
    \   analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n
    \   a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n    derivative
    of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n    treats it
    as such.\n    \n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary
    General\n    Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n
    \   sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n    concluded
    that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n    \n      However, unrestricted
    linking of non-free programs would deprive the\n    users of those programs of
    all benefit from the free status of the\n    libraries themselves.  This Library
    General Public License is intended to\n    permit developers of non-free programs
    to use free libraries, while\n    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs
    to change the free\n    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not
    seen how to achieve\n    this as regards changes in header files, but we have
    achieved it as regards\n    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The
    hope is that this\n    will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n    \n
    \     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification
    follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on
    the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains
    code derived from the library, while the latter only\n    works together with
    the library.\n    \n      Note that it is possible for a library to be covered
    by the ordinary\n    General Public License rather than by this special one.\n
    \   \f\n    \t\t  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n    \n      0. This License Agreement
    applies to any software library which\n    contains a notice placed by the copyright
    holder or other authorized\n    party saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this Library\n    General Public License (also called \"this License\").  Each
    licensee is\n    addressed as \"you\".\n    \n      A \"library\" means a collection
    of software functions and/or data\n    prepared so as to be conveniently linked
    with application programs\n    (which use some of those functions and data) to
    form executables.\n    \n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software
    library or work\n    which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based
    on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n
    \   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n    portion
    of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n    straightforwardly
    into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation
    in the term \"modification\".)\n    \n      \"Source code\" for a work means the
    preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For a library,
    complete source code means\n    all the source code for all modules it contains,
    plus any associated\n    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n    \n      Activities
    other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this
    License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program using
    the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent
    of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true
    depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library
    does.\n      \n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n
    \   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright
    notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer
    to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy
    of this License along with the\n    Library.\n    \n      You may charge a fee
    for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer
    warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n    \f\n      2. You may modify
    your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work
    based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work
    under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these
    conditions:\n    \n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n
    \   \n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n
    \       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    \n
    \       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge
    to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n    \n        d) If a facility
    in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be
    supplied by an application program that uses\n        the facility, other than
    as an argument passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make
    a good faith effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does
    not supply such function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs
    whatever part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n    \n        (For
    example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose
    that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n        application.  Therefore,
    Subsection 2d requires that any\n        application-supplied function or table
    used by this function must\n        be optional: if the application does not supply
    it, the square\n        root function must still compute square roots.)\n    \n
    \   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as
    separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must
    be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend
    to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n
    \   it.\n    \n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
    or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent
    is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective
    works based on the Library.\n    \n    In addition, mere aggregation of another
    work not based on the Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the
    Library) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
    other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n    \n      3. You may opt to
    apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this
    License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the
    notices that refer to this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU
    General Public License, version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer
    version than version 2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared,
    then you can specify\n    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any
    other change in\n    these notices.\n    \f\n      Once this change is made in
    a given copy, it is irreversible for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General
    Public License applies to all\n    subsequent copies and derivative works made
    from that copy.\n    \n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part
    of the code of\n    the Library into a program that is not a library.\n    \n
    \     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n    derivative
    of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n    under the terms
    of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n    it with the complete
    corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must be distributed under
    the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily used for software
    interchange.\n    \n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access
    to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
    the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n    distribute
    the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the
    source along with the object code.\n    \n      5. A program that contains no
    derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with the
    Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that uses
    the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
    Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n    \n      However,
    linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates an executable
    that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions of the
    Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable is
    therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution
    of such executables.\n    \n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material
    from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
    may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n
    \   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked
    without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for
    this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n    \n      If such an object
    file uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors,
    and small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length),
    then the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it
    is legally a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus
    portions of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n    \n      Otherwise,
    if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object
    code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing
    that work also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly
    with the Library itself.\n    \f\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above,
    you may also compile or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library
    to produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that
    work\n    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification
    of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging
    such modifications.\n    \n      You must give prominent notice with each copy
    of the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
    are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If
    the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n
    \   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing
    the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n
    \   \n        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable
    source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the
    work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if
    the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or
    source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink
    to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It
    is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files
    in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n
    \       to use the modified definitions.)\n    \n        b) Accompany the work
    with a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same
    user the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no
    more\n        than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    \n        c)
    If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a
    designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified
    materials from the same place.\n    \n        d) Verify that the user has already
    received a copy of these\n        materials or that you have already sent this
    user a copy.\n    \n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that
    uses the\n    Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n
    \   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the
    source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\n    distributed
    (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n    \n      It may happen that
    this requirement contradicts the license\n    restrictions of other proprietary
    libraries that do not normally\n    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction
    means you cannot\n    use both them and the Library together in an executable
    that you\n    distribute.\n    \f\n      7. You may place library facilities that
    are a work based on the\n    Library side-by-side in a single library together
    with other library\n    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
    such a combined\n    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
    based on\n    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted,
    and provided that you do these two things:\n    \n        a) Accompany the combined
    library with a copy of the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined
    with any other library\n        facilities.  This must be distributed under the
    terms of the\n        Sections above.\n    \n        b) Give prominent notice
    with the combined library of the fact\n        that part of it is a work based
    on the Library, and explaining\n        where to find the accompanying uncombined
    form of the same work.\n    \n      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link
    with, or distribute\n    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.
    \ Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute
    the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n    rights under this
    License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you
    under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.\n    \n      9. You are not required to accept
    this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants
    you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Library or its derivative works.
    \ These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
    \ Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based
    on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n
    \   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the
    Library or works based on it.\n    \n      10. Each time you redistribute the
    Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives
    a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify
    the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
    further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n
    \   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n    this
    License.\n    \f\n      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
    of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n
    \   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise)
    that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from
    the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy
    simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent
    obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Library at
    all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
    of the Library by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
    you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
    to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n    \n    If any portion
    of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance,
    the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole
    is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n    \n    It is not the purpose
    of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right
    claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole
    purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system
    which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n
    \   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through
    that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up
    to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software
    through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n    \n
    \   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be
    a consequence of the rest of this License.\n    \n      12. If the distribution
    and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents
    or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the
    Library under this License may add\n    an explicit geographical distribution
    limitation excluding those countries,\n    so that distribution is permitted only
    in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if\n    written in the body of this License.\n    \n      13.
    The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the
    Library General Public License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version,\n    but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.\n    \n    Each version is given a distinguishing
    version number.  If the Library\n    specifies a version number of this License
    which applies to it and\n    \"any later version\", you have the option of following
    the terms and\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published
    by\n    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n    license
    version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n    the Free Software
    Foundation.\n    \f\n      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library
    into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with
    these,\n    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n
    \   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software
    Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n    decision will be
    guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n    of all derivatives
    of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n
    \   \n    \t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n    \n      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED
    FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
    BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR\n    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n
    \   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n    LIBRARY
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n    THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n    \n      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS
    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
    OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED
    ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
    OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n
    \   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n    RENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n    FAILURE OF THE
    LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
    PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n    \n    \t\t
    \    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n    \f\n         Appendix: How to Apply These
    Terms to Your New Libraries\n    \n      If you develop a new library, and you
    want it to be of the greatest\n    possible use to the public, we recommend making
    it free software that\n    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so
    by permitting\n    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under
    the terms of the\n    ordinary General Public License).\n    \n      To apply
    these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n    safest to
    attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n    convey the
    exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n    \"copyright\"
    line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n    \n        <one line
    to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright
    (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    \n        This library is free software; you
    can redistribute it and/or\n        modify it under the terms of the GNU Library
    General Public\n        License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
    either\n        version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n
    \   \n        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n
    \       but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY
    or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n        Library General Public
    License for more details.\n    \n        You should have received a copy of the
    GNU Library General Public\n        License along with this library; if not, write
    to the Free\n        Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
    Boston,\n        MA 02110-1301, USA\n    \n    Also add information on how to
    contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n    \n    You should also get your
    employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n    school, if any, to sign a
    \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\n    necessary.  Here is a sample;
    alter the names:\n    \n      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest
    in the\n      library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random
    Hacker.\n    \n      <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n      Ty Coon, President

    \      1. Definitions.\n    \n          \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction,\n          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through
    9 of this document.\n    \n          \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner
    or entity authorized by\n          the copyright owner that is granting the License.\n

    all\n          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\n
    \         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\n          \"control\"
    means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\n          direction or
    management of such entity, whether by contract or\n          otherwise, or (ii)
    ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\n          outstanding shares,

    by this License.\n    \n          \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form
    for making modifications,\n          including but not limited to software source
    code, documentation\n          source, and configuration files.\n    \n          \"Object\"
    form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\n          transformation or

    types.\n    \n          \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in
    Source or\n          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated
    by a\n          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\n
    \         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n    \n          \"Derivative
    Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n          form, that
    is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n          editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n          represent,
    as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n          of this
    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n          separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n          the Work
    and Derivative Works thereof.\n    \n          \"Contribution\" shall mean any
    work of authorship, including\n          the original version of the Work and
    any modifications or additions\n          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally\n          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
    by the copyright owner\n          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized
    to submit on behalf of\n          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
    definition, \"submitted\"\n          means any form of electronic, verbal, or
    written communication sent\n          to the Licensor or its representatives,
    including but not limited to\n          communication on electronic mailing lists,
    source code control systems,\n          and issue tracking systems that are managed
    by, or on behalf of, the\n          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
    improving the Work, but\n          excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise\n          designated in writing by the copyright owner as
    \"Not a Contribution.\"\n    \n          \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and

    been received by Licensor and\n          subsequently incorporated within the
    Work.\n    \n       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions
    of\n          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
    \         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n          copyright
    license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\n          publicly display,

    Works in Source or Object form.\n    \n       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\n          this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,\n          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable\n          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make,
    have made,\n          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
    the Work,\n          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n
    \         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n          Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n          with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n          institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\n          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\n          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\n          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \         as of the date such litigation is filed.\n    \n       4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n          Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without\n          modifications, and in Source
    or Object form, provided that You\n          meet the following conditions:\n
    \   \n          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n              Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\n    \n          (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n    \n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative
    Works\n              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n
    \             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n              excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Derivative
    Works; and\n    \n          (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as
    part of its\n              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
    must\n              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
    \             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n              pertain
    to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n              of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative
    Works; within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along
    with the Derivative Works; or,\n              within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and\n              wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents\n              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n    \n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and\n          may provide additional or different license terms
    and conditions\n          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
    or\n          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n    \n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
    explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the
    terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n    \n       6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n          names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n          except
    as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin
    of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n    \n       7. Disclaimer
    of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n          agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each\n          Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
    either express or\n          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS
    FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
    any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n
    \   \n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n
    \         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n          unless
    required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n          negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You

    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n    \n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative

    to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n              of the following
    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative
    Works; within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along

    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n    \n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and\n          may provide additional or different license terms
    and conditions\n          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
    or\n          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n    \n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
    explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the
    terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n    \n       6.

    as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin
    of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n    \n       7. Disclaimer
    of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n          agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each\n          Contributor provides its Contributions)
    on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,

    \         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n          unless
    required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n          negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You
    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work (including but
    not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages or
    losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n    \n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
    While redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may

    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this

    \         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your
    accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n    \n       END OF TERMS

    License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n          separable
    from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n          the Work
    and Derivative Works thereof.\n    \n          \"Contribution\" shall mean any

    \         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n          Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n          with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n          institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\n          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\n          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\n          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \         as of the date such litigation is filed.\n    \n       4. Redistribution.

    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n    \n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative

    those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Derivative
    Works; and\n    \n          (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as
    part of its\n              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
    must\n              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n
    \             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n              pertain

    places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative
    Works; within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along

    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n    \n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
    modifications and\n          may provide additional or different license terms
    and conditions\n          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
    or\n          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n    \n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
    explicitly state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted
    for inclusion in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the
    terms and conditions of\n          this License, without any additional terms
    or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede
    or modify\n          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
    executed\n          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n    \n       6.
    Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n          names,

    as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n          origin
    of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n    \n       7. Disclaimer
    of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n          agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each\n          Contributor provides its Contributions)

    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n          liable to You
    for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n          incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a\n          result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work (including but
    not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage, computer
    failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages or
    losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n    \n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
    While redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
