    this file via license-tracking software should endeavor to understand which gem
    file you're downloading and using, so as not to misinterpret the contents of this
    file and the licenses of the software being distributed.\n\nYou can double-check
    the dependencies in your gem file by examining the output of `nokogiri -v` after
    installation, which will emit the complete set of libraries in use (for versions
    `>= 1.11.0.rc4`).\n\nIn particular, I'm sure somebody's lawyer, somewhere, is
    going to freak out that the LGPL appears in this file; and so I'd like to take
    special note that the dependency covered by LGPL, `libiconv`, is only being redistributed
    in the native Windows and native Darwin platform releases. It's not present in
    default, JavaⓇ, or native LinuxⓇ releases.\n\n\n## Platform Releases\n\n### Default
    platform release (\"ruby\")\n\nThe default platform release distributes the following
    dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n*
    [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n\nThis distribution can be identified by inspecting the
    included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\"
    attribute.\n\n\n### Native LinuxⓇ platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\", \"arm64-linux\",
    \"aarch64-linux\", and \"arm-linux\")\n\nThe native LinuxⓇ platform release distributes
    the following dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n*
    [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n* [zlib](#zlib)\n\nThis distribution can be identified
    by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar
    to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"arm64-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.\n\n\n###
    Native Darwin (macOSⓇ) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\")\n\nThe
    native Darwin platform release distributes the following dependencies in source
    form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n* [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n*
    [zlib](#zlib)\n* [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis distribution can be identified
    by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar
    to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin
    is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or \"macOSⓇ\" and is the operating system
    for many AppleⓇ computers.\n\n\n### Native WindowsⓇ platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\"
    and \"x64-mingw32\")\n\nThe native WindowsⓇ platform release distributes the following
    dependencies in source form:\n\n* [libxml2](#libxml2)\n* [libxslt](#libxslt)\n*
    [libgumbo](#libgumbo)\n* [zlib](#zlib)\n* [libiconv](#libiconv)\n\nThis distribution
    can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have
    a value similar to \"x64-mingw32\" or \"x86-mingw32\" for its \"platform.cpu\"
    attribute.\n\n\n### JavaⓇ (JRuby) platform release (\"java\")\n\nThe Java platform
    release distributes the following dependencies as compiled jar files:\n\n* [isorelax:isorelax](#isorelaxisorelax)\n*
    [net.sf.saxon:Saxon-HE](#netsfsaxonsaxon-he)\n* [net.sourceforge.htmlunit:neko-htmlunit](#netsourceforgehtmlunitneko-htmlunit)\n*
    [nu.validator:jing](#nuvalidatorjing)\n* [org.nokogiri:nekodtd](#orgnokogirinekodtd)\n*
    [xalan:serializer and xalan:xalan](#xalanserializer-and-xalanxalan)\n* [xerces:xercesImpl](#xercesxercesimpl)\n*
    [xml-apis:xml-apis](#xml-apisxml-apis)\n\nThis distribution can be identified
    by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"java\"
    for its \"platform.os\" attribute.\n\n\n## Appendix: Dependencies' License Texts\n\nThis
    section contains a subsection for each potentially-distributed dependency, which
    includes the name of the license and the license text.\n\nPlease see previous
    sections to understand which of these potential dependencies is actually distributed
    in the gem file you're downloading and using.\n\n\n### libgumbo\n\nApache 2.0\n\nhttps://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/main/gumbo-parser/src/README.md\n\n\n

    on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n          editorial revisions,
    annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n          represent, as a whole,
    an original work of authorship. For the purposes\n          of this License, Derivative
    Works shall not include works that remain\n          separable from, or merely
    link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n          the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.\n\n          \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship,
    including\n          the original version of the Work and any modifications or

    \         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\n
    \         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\n
    \         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\n
    \         designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n
    \         \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\n
    \         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\n
    \         subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n       2. Grant of Copyright
    License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n          this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n          worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n          copyright license to reproduce,
    prepare Derivative Works of,\n          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,

    of\n          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n
    \         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n          (except
    as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n          use,
    offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n          where
    such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n          by such
    Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n          Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n          with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n          institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\n          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\n          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\n          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \         as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n       4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n          Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without\n          modifications, and in Source
    or Object form, provided that You\n          meet the following conditions:\n\n
    \         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n              Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\n\n          (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n\n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
    \             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n              attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work,\n              excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Derivative Works; and\n\n
    \         (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n              distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n              include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\n              within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\n              pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one\n              of the following places: within
    a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along with
    the Derivative Works; or,\n              within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and\n              wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents\n              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n\n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n          for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n\n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
    in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
    of\n          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n          the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed\n          with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.\n\n       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\n          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\n          except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
    \         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n          implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\n\n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\n          whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
    \         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work
    (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer,\n          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
    \         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
    \         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
    \         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
    \         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend,
    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or
    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n###

    LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                   Version 2, June 1991\n\n     Copyright
    (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor,
    Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
    verbatim copies\n     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n
    \   [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n     numbered
    2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                    Preamble\n\n
    \     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n    freedom
    to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n    Licenses are
    intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n    free software--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n      This license, the Library
    General Public License, applies to some\n    specially designated Free Software
    Foundation software, and to any\n    other libraries whose authors decide to use
    it.  You can use it for\n    your libraries, too.\n\n      When we speak of free
    software, we are referring to freedom, not\n    price.  Our General Public Licenses
    are designed to make sure that you\n    have the freedom to distribute copies
    of free software (and charge for\n    this service if you wish), that you receive
    source code or can get it\n    if you want it, that you can change the software
    or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
    things.\n\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n
    \   anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These
    restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\n    you distribute
    copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n      For example, if you distribute
    copies of the library, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients
    all the rights that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
    or can get the source\n    code.  If you link a program with the library, you
    must provide\n    complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink
    them\n    with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\n
    \   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n      Our
    method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\n    the library,
    and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\n    permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n      Also, for each distributor's protection,
    we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty
    for this free\n    library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed
    on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\n
    \   version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\n    the
    original authors' reputations.\n    \f\n      Finally, any free program is threatened
    constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies
    distributing free\n    software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus
    in effect\n    transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent
    this,\n    we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\n
    \   free use or not licensed at all.\n\n      Most GNU software, including some
    libraries, is covered by the ordinary\n    GNU General Public License, which was
    designed for utility programs.  This\n    license, the GNU Library General Public
    License, applies to certain\n    designated libraries.  This license is quite
    different from the ordinary\n    one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume
    that anything in it is\n    the same as in the ordinary license.\n\n      The
    reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\n    they
    blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\n    program
    and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\n    changing
    the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\n    analogous
    to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\n    a textual
    and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\n    derivative of
    the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\n    treats it as
    such.\n\n      Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\n
    \   Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software\n    sharing,
    because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\n    concluded that weaker
    conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n      However, unrestricted linking
    of non-free programs would deprive the\n    users of those programs of all benefit
    from the free status of the\n    libraries themselves.  This Library General Public
    License is intended to\n    permit developers of non-free programs to use free
    libraries, while\n    preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change
    the free\n    libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how
    to achieve\n    this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
    it as regards\n    changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope
    is that this\n    will lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n      The
    precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.
    \ Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on the library\"
    and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains code derived from
    the library, while the latter only\n    works together with the library.\n\n      Note
    that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\n    General Public
    License rather than by this special one.\n    \f\n              GNU LIBRARY GENERAL
    PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n
    \     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\n    contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\n    party saying
    it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\n    General Public License
    (also called \"this License\").  Each licensee is\n    addressed as \"you\".\n\n
    \     A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n    prepared
    so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n    (which use some
    of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n      The \"Library\", below,
    refers to any such software library or work\n    which has been distributed under
    these terms.  A \"work based on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or
    any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Library or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated\n    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation
    is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n      \"Source
    code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications
    to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n    all the source code for
    all modules it contains, plus any associated\n    interface definition files,
    plus the scripts used to control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n\n
    \     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program
    using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered
    only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent
    of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true
    depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library
    does.\n\n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n
    \   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright
    notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer
    to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy
    of this License along with the\n    Library.\n\n      You may charge a fee for
    the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer
    warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n    \f\n      2. You may modify
    your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work
    based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work
    under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these
    conditions:\n\n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n
    \       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n        stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n        c) You must
    cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n        d) If a facility in the modified
    Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be supplied by an
    application program that uses\n        the facility, other than as an argument
    passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make a good faith
    effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does not supply such
    function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever
    part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n        (For example, a function
    in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose that is entirely well-defined
    independent of the\n        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that
    any\n        application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n
    \       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n        root
    function must still compute square roots.)\n\n    These requirements apply to
    the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are
    not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent
    and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
    apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
    when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work
    based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
    of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire
    whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n    it.\n\n    Thus,
    it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights
    to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right
    to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the
    Library.\n\n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
    Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume
    of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n
    \   the scope of this License.\n\n      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the
    ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this License to a given copy
    of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to
    this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
    version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version
    2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n
    \   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n    these
    notices.\n    \f\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible
    for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n
    \   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n      This
    option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n    the Library into
    a program that is not a library.\n\n      4. You may copy and distribute the Library
    (or a portion or\n    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
    form\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n
    \   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must
    be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily
    used for software interchange.\n\n      If distribution of object code is made
    by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement
    to\n    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled
    to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n      5. A program that contains
    no derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with
    the Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that
    uses the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work
    of the Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n
    \     However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates
    an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions
    of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable
    is therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution
    of such executables.\n\n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material
    from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
    may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n
    \   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked
    without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for
    this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n      If such an object file
    uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors, and
    small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length), then
    the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
    a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions
    of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n      Otherwise, if the
    work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object code for
    the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing that work
    also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly with the
    Library itself.\n    \f\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may
    also compile or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to
    produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n
    \   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification
    of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging
    such modifications.\n\n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of
    the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
    are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If
    the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n
    \   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing
    the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n\n
    \       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable
    source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the
    work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if
    the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or
    source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink
    to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It
    is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files
    in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n
    \       to use the modified definitions.)\n\n        b) Accompany the work with
    a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same user
    the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n
    \       than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n        c) If distribution
    of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a designated place,
    offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified materials from the
    same place.\n\n        d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of
    these\n        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n      For
    an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n    Library\" must
    include any data and utility programs needed for\n    reproducing the executable
    from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the source code distributed need
    not include anything that is normally\n    distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
    system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n
    \   the executable.\n\n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the
    license\n    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n
    \   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n    use
    both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n    distribute.\n
    \   \f\n      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n
    \   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n    facilities
    not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n    library, provided
    that the separate distribution of the work based on\n    the Library and of the
    other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted, and provided that you do
    these two things:\n\n        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of
    the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n
    \       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n        Sections
    above.\n\n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n
    \       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n        where
    to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n      8. You may
    not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n    the Library except
    as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy,
    modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute the Library is void, and will
    automatically terminate your\n    rights under this License.  However, parties
    who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you under this License will not
    have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n
    \     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed
    it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute
    the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law
    if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing
    the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance
    of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing
    or modifying\n    the Library or works based on it.\n\n      10. Each time you
    redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient
    automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute,
    link with or modify the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You
    may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
    rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
    third parties to\n    this License.\n    \f\n      11. If, as a consequence of
    a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason
    (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by
    court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
    License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If
    you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
    this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n
    \   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license
    would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n    all those
    who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way
    you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from
    distribution of the Library.\n\n    If any portion of this section is held invalid
    or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section
    is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in
    other circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you
    to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n
    \   integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n    implemented
    by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions
    to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance
    on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to
    decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system
    and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended
    to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest
    of this License.\n\n      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is
    restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the\n    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
    add\n    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n
    \   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.
    \ In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n    written in
    the body of this License.\n\n      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish
    revised and/or new\n    versions of the Library General Public License from time
    to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n
    \   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each
    version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n    specifies

    than patent or trademark)\n        Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce,

    \   2.2. Effective Date\n\n    The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect

    Contributor first\n    distributes such Contribution.\n\n    2.3. Limitations
    on Grant Scope\n\n    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights
    granted under\n    this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied
    from the\n    distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n
    \   Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n
    \   Contributor:\n\n    (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered
    Software;\n        or\n\n    (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any

    \       Version); or\n\n    (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software
    in the absence of\n        its Contributions.\n\n    This License does not grant
    any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n    or logos of any Contributor
    (except as may be necessary to comply with\n    the notice requirements in Section
    3.4).\n\n    2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n    No Contributor makes additional grants
    as a result of Your choice to\n    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent
    version of this\n    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary
    License (if\n    permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n    2.5. Representation\n\n
    \   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n    Contributions
    are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n    to grant the rights
    to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n    2.6. Fair Use\n\n    This
    License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n    applicable copyright
    doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n    equivalents.\n\n    2.7. Conditions\n\n
    \   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\n    in
    Section 2.1.\n\n    3. Responsibilities\n    -------------------\n\n    3.1. Distribution
    of Source Form\n\n    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form,
    including any\n    Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must
    be under\n    the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n
    \   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n    License,
    and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n    attempt to alter
    or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n    Form.\n\n    3.2. Distribution
    of Executable Form\n\n    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form
    then:\n\n    (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n
    \       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n
    \       the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n        Form
    by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n        than the
    cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n    (b) You may distribute such
    Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under
    different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does
    not attempt to limit or alter\n        the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form under this License.\n\n    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n    You
    may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n    provided
    that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n    the Covered
    Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n    Software with a
    work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n    Covered Software
    is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n    License permits You to
    additionally distribute such Covered Software\n    under the terms of such Secondary
    License(s), so that the recipient of\n    the Larger Work may, at their option,
    further distribute the Covered\n    Software under the terms of either this License
    or such Secondary\n    License(s).\n\n    3.4. Notices\n\n    You may not remove
    or alter the substance of any license notices\n    (including copyright notices,
    patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n    or limitations of liability) contained
    within the Source Code Form of\n    the Covered Software, except that You may
    alter any license notices to\n    the extent required to remedy known factual
    inaccuracies.\n\n    3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n    You may choose
    to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability
    obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n    Software. However, You may
    do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n    behalf of any Contributor. You
    must make it absolutely clear that any\n    such warranty, support, indemnity,
    or liability obligation is offered by\n    You alone, and You hereby agree to
    indemnify every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by such Contributor
    as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    You may include additional\n    disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability
    specific to any\n    jurisdiction.\n\n    4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute
    or Regulation\n    ---------------------------------------------------\n\n    If
    it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n    License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\n    statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n    the terms of this License
    to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n    describe the limitations and the
    code they affect. Such description must\n    be placed in a text file included
    with all distributions of the Covered\n    Software under this License. Except
    to the extent prohibited by statute\n    or regulation, such description must
    be sufficiently detailed for a\n    recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
    understand it.\n\n    5. Termination\n    --------------\n\n    5.1. The rights
    granted under this License will terminate automatically\n    if You fail to comply
    with any of its terms. However, if You become\n    compliant, then the rights
    granted under this License from a particular\n    Contributor are reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until such\n    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates
    Your grants, and (b) on an\n    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify
    You of the\n    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after
    You have\n    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n
    \   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n    notifies
    You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\n    first time
    You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\n    from such Contributor,
    and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\n    Your receipt of the notice.\n\n
    \   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n
    \   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n    counter-claims,
    and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly
    infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n    You by any and all Contributors
    for the Covered Software under Section\n    2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n
    \   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n    end
    user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n    have
    been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n    prior
    to termination shall survive termination.\n\n    ************************************************************************\n

    \   *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *\n
    \   *  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *\n

    its principal\n    place of business and such litigation shall be governed by
    laws of that\n    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\n
    \   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\n    cross-claims
    or counter-claims.\n\n    9. Miscellaneous\n    ----------------\n\n    This License

    in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
    \         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n          implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,

    and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
    \         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work
    (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer,\n          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
    \         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
    \         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
    \         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
    \         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend,
    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or
    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n###

    and\n          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n          for

    the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
    \         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT

    or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose

    such Contributions.\n\n       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\n          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\n          except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
    \         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n          implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\n\n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\n          whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
    \         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work
    (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer,\n          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n
    \         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n
    \         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
    \         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
    \         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend,
    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or
    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n###

    License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n          this License, each

    such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n          by such
    Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n          Contribution(s)
    alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n          with the Work to which
    such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n          institute patent litigation
    against any entity (including a\n          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work\n          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct\n          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent
    licenses\n          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n
    \         as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n       4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n          Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without\n          modifications, and in Source
    or Object form, provided that You\n          meet the following conditions:\n\n
    \         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n              Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\n\n          (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\n              stating that You changed the files;
    and\n\n          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n
    \             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n              attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work,\n              excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of\n              the Derivative Works; and\n\n
    \         (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n              distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n              include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\n              within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\n              pertain to any part of the
    Derivative Works, in at least one\n              of the following places: within
    a NOTICE text file distributed\n              as part of the Derivative Works;
    within the Source form or\n              documentation, if provided along with
    the Derivative Works; or,\n              within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and\n              wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents\n              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
    only and\n              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n
    \             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n
    \             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n              that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n              as modifying
    the License.\n\n          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications
    and\n          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n
    \         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n          for
    any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n          reproduction,
    and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n          the conditions
    stated in this License.\n\n       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise,\n          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion
    in the Work\n          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
    of\n          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n          Notwithstanding
    the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n          the terms of any
    separate license agreement you may have executed\n          with Licensor regarding
    such Contributions.\n\n       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission
    to use the trade\n          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names
    of the Licensor,\n          except as required for reasonable and customary use
    in describing the\n          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
    the NOTICE file.\n\n       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or\n          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n
    \         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n          WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n          implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the\n          appropriateness of using or redistributing
    the Work and assume any\n          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
    under this License.\n\n       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under
    no legal theory,\n          whether in tort (including negligence), contract,
    or otherwise,\n          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
    and grossly\n          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor
    be\n          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n
    \         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n
    \         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n          Work
    (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n          work stoppage,
    computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n          other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor\n          has been advised of the possibility
    of such damages.\n\n       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
    redistributing\n          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
    to offer,\n          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n

    \         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n
    \         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n
    \         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n          defend,
    and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n          incurred by, or
    claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n          of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
